# TeRmR
Remote Terminal


A centralised server runs programs at two ports : one for telnet connection and the other for SSH connection.
Clients need to enter the appropriate ip and port of the server they want to access along with their user id and password.
If valid clients can execute linux commands using the client interface no matter of the os they are working on!
